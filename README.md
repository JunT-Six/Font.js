Font.js - lifting the hood on your fonts
===

If you're looking for the (really) old version of Font.js, [go here](https://github.com/Pomax/Font.js/tree/v2015).

With that out of the way: what if you could actually inspect your web fonts? In the same context that you actually _use_ those web fonts?

That's what this is for.
